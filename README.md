# Portfolio Project - Efficient Help

## Setting up the stage

Imagine that an international charity organization called Efficient Help approaches us for support. Their objective is to help people in developing countries to improve their life expectancy but as their name suggests they want to do this efficiently. The mortality rate<sup>1</sup> is a good measure to detect places of the world where people would need help. However, if the selected country is difficult to reach or traverse the resources are used up by the logistics. 

## The question

Which country has a 
  * high mortality rate
  * has a sea shore or is flat enough to easily travel through

## The data

The decision should be based on two types of data: [mortality rate](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/IHME_GBD_2010_MORTALITY_AGE_SPECIFIC_BY_COUNTRY_1970_2010.csv) and [terrain ruggedness](https://diegopuga.org/data/rugged/).
